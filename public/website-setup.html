<P>This article will discuss how to create a simple website on an iPad.</P>

<p>For doing the coding and Github management on the iPad, I gave Working Copy a try. The website itself utilized Node and Express and is just a basic brochure site.</p>

<p>The steps I took were:</p>
<ol>
<li> Created a new Github repo</li>
<li> Connected to the Github repo from Working Copy</li>
<ol type="A" >
    <li>    Click the "+" at the top left of the Working Copy Home Screen</li>
    <li>    Select "Clone Repository"</li>
</ol>


<li> Created a README with the inital steps I was going to take.</li>
</ol>
