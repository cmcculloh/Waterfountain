<P>This article will discuss how to create a simple website on an iPad.</P>

<p>For doing the coding and Github management on the iPad, I gave Working Copy a try. The website itself utilized Node and Express and is just a basic brochure site.</p>

<p>The steps I took were:</p>
<ol>
    <li> Created a new Github repo
        <ol type="A">
            <li>Went to github.com
Clicked on the new repository button

Filled in my details and clicked create repository</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li> Connected to the Github repo from Working Copy</li>
    <ol type="A" >
        <li>    Click the "+" at the top left of the Working Copy Home Screen</li>
        <li>    Select "Clone Repository"</li>
    </ol>


    <li> Created a README with the inital steps I was going to take.</li>
    <ol type="A">
<li>    In working copy, I opened the README (you can tell it to start you out with a README)</li>

</ol>
