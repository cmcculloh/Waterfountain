<P>This article will discuss how to create a simple website on an iPad.</P>

<p>For doing the coding and Github management on the iPad, I gave Working </p> <p>Copy a try. The website itself utilized Node and Express and is just </p>      <p>a basic brochure site.</p>

<p>The steps I took were:</p>

<p>1. Created a new Github repo</p>
<p>2. Connected to the Github repo from Working Copy</p>
    <p>    A. Click the "+" at the top left of the Working Copy Home Screen</p>
    <p>    B. Select "Clone Repository"</p>
    


<p>3. Created a README with the inital steps I was going to take.</p>
