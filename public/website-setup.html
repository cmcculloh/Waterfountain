<P>This article will discuss how to create a simple website on an iPad.</P>

For doing the coding and Github management on the iPad, I gave Working Copy a try. The website itself utilized Node and Express and is just a basic brochure site.

The steps I took were:

1. Created a new Github repo
2. Connected to the Github repo from Working Copy
    A. Click the "+" at the top left of the Working Copy Home Screen
    B. Select "Clone Repository"
    


3. Created a README with the inital steps I was going to take.
